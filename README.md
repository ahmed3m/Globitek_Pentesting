# Project 8 - Pentesting Live Targets

Time spent: **12** hours spent in total

> Objective: Identify vulnerabilities in three different versions of the Globitek website: blue, green, and red.

The six possible exploits are:
* Username Enumeration
* Insecure Direct Object Reference (IDOR)
* SQL Injection (SQLi)
* Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)
* Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF)
* Session Hijacking/Fixation

Each version of the site has been given two of the six vulnerabilities. (In other words, all six of the exploits should be assignable to one of the sites.)

## Blue

Vulnerability #1: SQL Injection (SQLi)

There's an SQLi vulnerability in the id parameter for the salesperson. I used a blind SQLi `' OR SLEEP(5)=0--'` to trigger it.

Vulnerability #2: Session Hijacking/Fixation

For the session hijacking, the attacker (on the right) was able to retrieve the PHPSESSID of the logged in admin (on the left). Using that PHPSESSID allowed the attacker to login.

For the session fixation, the attacker (on the right) was able to change the PHPSESSID for the logged in admin (on the left); therefore, allowing both the attacker and the admin to use the same session id which allows the attacker to login.

## Green

Vulnerability #1: User Enumeration

The site contains a vulnerability as it allows us to figure out which users already exist. If they already exist, the error message was given in bold. If the username does not exist, the error message wasn't bold. This can give us valuable information on which usernames exist.

Vulnerability #2: Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)

One of the input fields is not sanitized when being outputted, which allows for a stored XSS.
